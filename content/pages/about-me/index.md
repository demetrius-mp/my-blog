## My journey

I was born in Corumbá - MS, Brazil, but I moved to Campo Grande - MS, Brazil
to finish my 2 last years in high school.

Finished high school at the end of 2018, and started my Bachelor in
Software Engineering at the first semester of 2019. In the beginning,
I wasn't sure if it was the right choice, but after about a month,
I couldn't be happier about what I was studying.

During my undergraduate, I joined a research group as volunteer. The topic of
research was SLR's (Systematic Literature Review).

- ### About the research
  
  My goal was to build a tool that automated the process of
  Forward Snowballing, that consists of retrieving which studies cited
  a given study. Also, with the help of another member of the research group,
  we did some refactoring on a tool built by an ex-member, named SeSG.

After 7 semesters, I finished undergrad, and started my master's degree on the
second semester of 2022. My plan is to keep researching about SLR's.
